Hello my name is Daniel Rendon. I am a student at the university of arizona and I am majoring in computer science.
I have an associate's degree at Pima Community College. I also played soccer during my time at Pima and was part of a national
title winning team. My goal is to get a bachelor's degree at the university of arizona and get a job at a big tech company
like google, apple, etc.
